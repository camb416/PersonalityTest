PersonalityTest

uses: libBigDigitDriver
https://github.com/camb416/BigDigitDriver

This includes the microcontroller software for running a counting interactive using analog rotary switches.

Electronics for this include an Arduino board, an AMNH Personality Sheild (testing using v0.3) and an AMNH Big Digit Driver board (BDD) (testing using v1.4)

A C version and an Arduino PDE version are both included. Both require the libBigDigitDriver to talk to the Seven Segment Display boards.

When opening the PDE, you'll need to delete the .cpp file or Arduino is going to try to compile it (and fail).
